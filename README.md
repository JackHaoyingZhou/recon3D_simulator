# recon3D_simulator
Educational simulator for the reconstruction of virtual objects from a pair of images.

This example code aims to help students understand how and in what extend the various variables of a SfM scheme affect the final result.

Includes implementations of some algorithms from Kenichi Kanatani's book "Statistical Optimization for Geometric Computation".

Matlab version is done.
C++ is under development.
